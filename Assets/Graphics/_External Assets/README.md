# External Assets
Contains 3rd party asset packs.

The preferred folder structure is: `[Asset Pack Name]/[Asset Pack Contents]...`. If there is a common asset pack creator/studio (e.g. Synty Studios), they should be organized inside a common folder: `[Asset Pack Creator]/[Asset Pack Name]/[Asset Pack Contents]`.
